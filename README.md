# Pill-Identification-System

Identify commonly found pills by typing in a description.
This program was created to help identify pills that were most commonly found in the area. 
Typing in a description of it (or also by name) will show the user what it is and what to do with it. 
I created the program, but the descriptions of pills and other pill data were gathered and created by someone else. 

Created in August 2016.
