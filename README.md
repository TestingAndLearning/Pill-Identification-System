# Pill-Identification-System

Identify commonly found pills by typing in a description.
This program was created to help identify pills that were most commonly found in the area. 
Typing in a description of it (or also by name) will show the user what it is and what to do with it. 
I created the program, but the descriptions of pills and other pill data were gathered and created by someone else. 

I did not use SQL or spreadsheets because of environment limitations. These limitations include needing the project to be easily portable and not being able to use certain plugins and technology. Creating a database this way seemed like a suitable solution given the limitations. 

Created in August 2016.
